# Downloads

For each commit to the `master` branch in the Perlang repo, a new snapshot release of the Perlang interpreter is built and published to Bintray.

Here is the URL: https://bintray.com/perlang/builds/perlang#files. Unfortunately, there is no easy way at the moment to find out what is the "latest snapshot" apart than looking at the file name (which includes the date & time, as well as the Git SHA-1 "object name" (i.e. commit ID)).

Sometime in the future, we are aiming to provide something like [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Perlang, to make the installation process smoother.
